A refactoring of the BASIC games from the 1978 book BASIC Computer Games by Creative Computing (compiled by David H. Ahl) into modern Python 3 for educational purposes.

These games are believed to be in the public domain given the nature of the book and no copyright infringement is intended.

The original source code of the games can be accessed here:
